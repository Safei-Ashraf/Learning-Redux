## Write a movie app. The app has some of the following functions:
    - add a movie
    - view all the movies
    - add movie details
    - delete a movie
    - rate a movie
    - get all the users who rated a movie
    - get the overall movie rate
    - add a movie to user's faviourites
    - add a movie to a user watched list
    - get all users who watched a movie
    - get how many minutes a user watched a certain movie


- Examples:
    - addMovie()      // adds a movie with whatever details you decide to add
    - deleteMovie()   // deletes a movie
    - getMovie()      // gets a movie with its detials
    - getMovies()     // get all movies
    - rateMovie()     // rates a movie

- Notes to consider:-

    - The app must use redux to manage the state of the app.
    - Add your custom Redux implementation. Don't use the library
    - HTML & vanilla javascript only allowed. No framework or any library or bundler like webpack should be used.
    - The app should run in browser console.
    - The above examples just for demonestrations, pick any suitable name, pass any parameters that fit your needs.


    app.addUser => adds a user.
//adding movie before user or admin cause movies to return undefined.
